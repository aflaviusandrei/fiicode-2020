Create a Web / Mobile application that offers a friendly interface to assist people with various allergies. The application will be able to manage (types of) allergies
and notify a person or group of users about the occurrence of a seasonal allergy (eg: pollen, direct exposure to the sun or dust, etc.), possibly in conjunction with
certain fruits or food compounds, and / or according to environmental conditions (eg temperature, humidity, etc.). Notifications will be flagged, including a certain
priority / frequency, both within the application and on a mobile device (phone, tablet) of the user or a contact person. Tips will also be provided regarding the
prevention of an allergy, plus treatment and / or medication. Users will be able to add your allergies, with the possibility of being shared at group level, including
at the level of a social network. The various statistics of interest will be offered via attractive visualizations, and the interaction with the user can also be
carried out through a conversation agent.
