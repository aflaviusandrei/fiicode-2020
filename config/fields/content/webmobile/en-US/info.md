# ABOUT WEB/MOBILE

The competition takes place in teams of 2-3 people which will get from the organisers, after the registration period, a task with a specific theme and a deadline of 9 weeks.
After the first 3 weeks, the teams must present their project (a repo Github link). After the end of the 9 weeks, the competitors will make a presentation video of the
project which they will upload on the same site. The jury will analise the Github projects (along with the video) for a week before they will contact the top 3 teams
that will compete in a 8-hour hackaton with a known task. For the development of apps,any technologies can be used as long as the app can be opened in any browser and/or
the app can be installed and used on a mobile platform.  
**This year’s Web & Mobile section’s theme** will raise a technical, yet creative challenge by not being specific, but rather centered around the word retro. The participants are free to create their projects in any way they want, as long as they follow the theme.  
The participants must ensure that they will deliver an application with a generated source code (HTML, CSS, Javascript), client level (front-end) and/or server (back-end).  
There are no restrictions regarding resources (frameworks, libraries), but it will be taken in consideration that those frameworks have to be as responsive as possible.
